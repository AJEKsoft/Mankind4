[X] Basic math functions, vectors and matrices
[X] Camera class
[X] Some mesh classes, as well as a chunk mesh
[ ] Fix camera perspective calculation
[ ] Fix lighting calculation in shader
[ ] IMPORTANT: messaging system for inter-class communication

Considerations:

* Packing color, lighting, and visible data into one byte â€” how?
  Perhaps like so: 1 bit visible, 2 bits red, 2 bits green, 1 bit
  blue, 2 bits lighting. This means we have 32 available colors, plus
  4 lighting values.
